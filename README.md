üåçGreenhouse Gas Emission Analysis & Prediction
This project analyzes and predicts greenhouse gas emissions from commodity and industry sources between 2010 and 2016. It combines multiple Excel sheets, cleans the data, visualizes emission trends, and trains a machine learning model to predict emissions using Random Forest.

Overview
Combines yearly commodity and industry data into a unified dataset
Cleans and standardizes column names
Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Visualizes emissions over time for the top emitting entities
Trains a Random Forest model to predict emissions based on features like year, type, and source
Saves the trained model for future use
Dataset
Format: Excel sheets named YYYY_Detail_Commodity and YYYY_Detail_Industry for each year from 2010 to 2016
Key columns:
